# Python GUI Calculator

This is a **Scientific Calculator** desktop application built using **Python** and **Tkinter**.

## Project Overview

The Python GUI Calculator provides both **basic** and **scientific** mathematical operations within a simple, user-friendly interface.  
It supports arithmetic operations, trigonometric functions, logarithms, square roots, factorials, and more.

## Key Features

- Scientific operations:
  - Trigonometric functions: `sin()`, `cos()`, `tan()`, `cot()`, `sec()`, `cosec()`
  - Logarithmic function: `log()`
  - Square root: `√`
  - Square: `x²`
  - Factorial: `x!`
- Clear (`C`) and Backspace (`⌫`) functionality
- Responsive and interactive UI
- Built with **Tkinter** (Python's standard GUI library)

## Technologies Used
- **Python** (v3.x)
- **Tkinter** for GUI design
- **math** library for scientific computations

## How to Run
1. Make sure you have **Python** installed.
2. Save the script as `calculator.py`.
